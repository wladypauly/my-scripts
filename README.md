my-scripts
==========

Scripts I made for my personal use and which I want to share.
I must say I am almost a complete newbie when it comes to scripting and stuff, these are just some "serious games" I play for fun and learning. I do not have too much time to spend on bash scripting for the moment, so my scripts are at that level - newbie, newbie one.
